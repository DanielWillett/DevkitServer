# Privacy Policy
`DevkitServer`, `DevkitServer.Launcher`, or `DevkitServer.Resources` do not collect any information about the user whatsoever.

`DevkitServer.Server` does communicate with clients directly in some cases (instead of through Steam servers). This can be disabled in the server settings (`enable_high_speed_support: false`).

As a client, be aware that there is no limit to what a server host could put in the map that is sent to your client. Make sure you trust the server you are joining.
While there is a file type filter, it's easy enough to get around.

## DevkitServer.Launcher
NuGet collects some information when downloading a DevkitServer update or checking for updates.

This applies to anyone using `DevkitServer.Launcher`.

Their policies can be read here: https://github.com/NuGet/Home/blob/dev/Privacy-Policy.md, https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement

To avoid this, install DevkitServer manually.
